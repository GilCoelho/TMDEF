{% block form_purpose %}
The purpose of this project is for the member to introduce themselves to the club and learn the basic structure of a
public speech.
{% endblock %}

{% block form_notes %}
This member is completing their first speech in Toastmasters. The goal of the evaluation is to give the member
an effective evaluation of their speech and delivery style. Because the “Ice Breaker” is the first project a member
completes, you may choose to use only the notes section and not the numerical score.
If you know you will be the evaluator ahead of the meeting, communicate with the speaker to learn about them and
their goals for their first speech. Be sure to set aside enough time in your schedule to meet with the speaker after
their speech to review the evaluation and answer any questions they may have.
